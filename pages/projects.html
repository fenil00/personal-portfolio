                <p>In many applications such as security system (locking systems, theft alert), rules and
                    regulations (e.g. Breaking of traffic signals) and personal data of an individual person (e.g.
                    Passport, National ID cards) we require face detection. Hence we have decided to make a
                    simple face detection system using a RaspberryPi 3 module with the help of a camera.</p>

                    </figure>
                <p>We begin the project by installing OpenCV in RaspberryPi 3. We capture the data through
                    Camera. We process it and detect the face using OpenCV algorithms and compare it with
                    the database photos to detect the person in Real time.</p>
                <p>This project can be utilized in many security systems, theft detection and Identity detection
                    systems.</p>

               <p>Conception and development of a die
                cushion model for virtual commissioning
                based on Matlab/Simulink</p>

                <p>For demanding jobs in bodywork, hydraulic drawing equipment is increasingly being used in
                    mechanical presses as well. The advantage of hydraulic pulling devices over pneumatic systems
                    lies in the exact adjustability of the holding force. Proportional or servo valves allow a
                    sensitive adjustment to the different drawn parts and, if necessary, a drawing process with different
                    holding forces.</p>
                <p>The technique of the multi-point die cushion is based on the fact that several cylinders are
                    arranged under the pressure cheek, which can be programmed to different holding force. The
                    different counter-holding force causes the pressure cheek and die cushion plate holder to change
                    their parallel position and thus also the blank holder force between upper tool and blank holder.</p>

                        <figcaption>Single-action mechanical press with draw cushion</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <p>If the pressure is increased on a counter-holding cylinder, the blank holder force increases
                    less material flow in the mold. If the pressure is reduced, however, more material flows into the
                    mold.</p>
                <p>Hardware-in-the-loop simulation model for a one-point hydraulic drawing cushion is to be modeled as part of the final work. The controlled system is to be modeled and has
                    a real-time capability Interface to the TwinCAT III controller (position and pressure control).</p>
                <p>With the help of a simulation model, drawing cushions can be put into virtual operation in
                    the future. By the virtual commissioning, design errors can be detected early and corrected.</p>
